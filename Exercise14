**Prompt**

Below program asks user for three integers and prints the smallest and largest of those three on screen.
Your task is to write the missing functions (largest() and smallest ()), which receive the user input as
parameters and return the largest and smallest integers, respectively.

**Solution**

//This is the code that can't be modified
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int largest(int first, int second, int third);
int smallest(int first, int second, int third);

int main() {
int number1, number2, number3, largestNumber, smallestNumber;
cout << "Input the first integer:";
cin >> number1;
cout << "Input the second integer:";
cin >> number2;
cout << "Input the third integer:";
cin >> number3;
largestNumber = largest(number1, number2, number3);
smallestNumber = smallest(number1, number2, number3);
cout << "The largest number was " << largestNumber;
cout << " and smallest " << smallestNumber << "." << endl;
}

//my code
int largest(int a, int b, int c) {
	if(a > b && a > c) {
		return a;
	}
	else if(b > a && b > c) {
		a = b;
		return a;
	}
	else {
		a = c;
		return a;
	}
}
	
int smallest(int a, int b, int c) {
	if(a < b && a < c) {
		return a;
	}
	else if(b < a && b < c) {
		a = b;
		return a;
	}
	else {
		a = c;
		return a;	
	}
}
