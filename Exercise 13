**Prompt**

Write a program that asks for student's exam grades (integers 4-10 inclusive) and prints the average of the given numbers.
Integers outside of the 4-10 range should not be included when calculating the average. Program receives numbers until input is finished by inputting a negative number. Finally the program prints the amount of grades and their average.

Tip:

You can use either while or do-while statement for this exercise. Use floating point numbers for storing grades and their average.

Example print

Program calculates the average of exam grades.

Finish inputting with a negative number.

Input grade (4-10) 5

Input grade (4-10) 7

Input grade (4-10) 8

Input grade (4-10) 10

Input grade (4-10) 7

Input grade (4-10) -1

You inputted 5 grades.

Grade average: 7.4

**Solution**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
	int count = 0;
	double number = 0;
	double sum = 0;
	
	cout << "Program calculates the test grade average." << endl;
	cout << "Finish inputting with a negative number." << endl;
	
	while(count >= 0)
	{
		cout << "Input grade (4-10) ";
		cin >> number;
		
		if (number < 0) {
			cout << "You inputted " << count << " grades." << endl;
			cout << "Grade average: "<< sum / count << endl;
			break;
		}
		else {
			count++;
			sum += number;	
		}
	}
}
