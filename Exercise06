Input first integer: 3

Input second integer: 5

3+5 = 8

3-5 = -2

3*5 = 15

Remainder: 3

**Solution**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int firstNumber;
	int secondNumber;
	
	cout << "Input first integer:";
	cin >> firstNumber;
	cout << "Input second integer:";
	cin >> secondNumber;
	
	cout << "" << firstNumber << "+" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber + secondNumber << endl;
	cout << "" << firstNumber << "-" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber - secondNumber << endl;
	cout << "" << firstNumber << "*" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber * secondNumber << endl;
	cout << "Remainder: " << firstNumber % secondNumber << endl;
}
