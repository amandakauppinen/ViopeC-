**Prompt**

Write a program that asks user for an integer n (n>0) and prints the factorial of that number on screen.
Example: factorial of n is marked with n!, which means 1*2*3...n

**Solution**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
	int i;
	int factorial = 1;
	int number;
	
	cout << "Input an integer:";
	cin >> number;
	
	for(i = 1; i <= number; i++)
	{
		factorial = factorial * i;
	}
	
	cout <<"The factorial of number " << number << " is " << factorial << endl;
	return 0;
}
