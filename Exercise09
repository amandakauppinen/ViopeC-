**Prompt**

Write a program that asks the users gender and age. Finally the program prints a sentence based on the following rule:

* Male 0-55 years: "You are a man in his prime!"

* Male 56-100 years: "You are a wise man!"

* Female 0-55 years: "You are like a blooming flower!"

* Female 56-100 years: "You look young for your age!"

* Else "Error encountered!"

Age is handled as an integer variable and gender as string variable (m/f). Letter case is ignored.

Tip:

Use enough time to plan for the program before starting to code.

Example print

Are you a male or a female (m/f): m

Your age: 44

You are a man in his prime!

**Solution**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char gender;
	int age;
	
	cout << "Are you a male or a female (m/f):";
	cin >> gender;
	
	cout << "Your age:";
	cin >> age;
	
	if (gender == 'm')
		if (age <= 55)
			cout << "You are a man in his prime!" << endl;
		else
			cout << "You are a wise man!" << endl;
	
	else if (gender == 'f')
		if (age <= 55)
			cout << "You are like a blooming flower!" << endl;
		else
			cout << "You look young for your age!" << endl;
	else 
		cout << "An error occured in the program!" << endl;
}
