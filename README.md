# Viope C++ Summer Course problems

These are my solutions to the Viope course I took for C++, summer 2018.
I used the in-browser editor to do the exercises, so I just copy/pasted the prompt as well as my solution into the git file.
This course was taken before I had taken any official C++ course, so the solutions are not necessarily reflective of choices
I would make now.
