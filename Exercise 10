**Prompt**

Enhance the previous calculator program so that the user can choose which operation he wants to perform.
The program first asks for the performed calculation. After this the program asks for the integers, performs
the calculation and prints the result. Make the choice structure with switch() statement.

Tip:

Calculations are printed ad follows:

Subtraction: x-y=z

Addition: x+y=z

Multiplication: x*y=z

Remainder: x%y=z

Example print

Choose from the following calculations:

1. subtraction

2. addition

3. Multiplication

4. Division

5. Remainder

Choose a calculation: 2

Input first number: 33

Input second number: 12

33+12=45

**Solution**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int functionNumber;
	int firstNumber;
	int secondNumber;
	
	cout << "Choose desired calculation:" <<endl;
	cout << "1: subtraction" << endl;
	cout << "2: addition" << endl;
	cout << "3: multiplication" << endl;
	cout << "4: division" << endl;
	cout << "5: Remainder" << endl;
	
	cout << "Choose a calculation:";
	cin >> functionNumber;
	
	cout << "Input first number:";
	cin >> firstNumber;
	
	cout << "Input second number:";
	cin >> secondNumber;
	
	
	switch(functionNumber) 
	{ 
		case 1:
			cout << "" << firstNumber << "-" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber - secondNumber << endl; 
			break;
		case 2:
			cout << "" << firstNumber << "+" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber + secondNumber << endl; 
			break;
		case 3:
			cout << "" << firstNumber << "*" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber * secondNumber << endl; 
			break;
		case 4:
			cout << "" << firstNumber << "/" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber / secondNumber << endl; 
			break;
		case 5:
			cout << "" << firstNumber << "%" << secondNumber << " = " << firstNumber % secondNumber << endl; 
			break;
	}
}
